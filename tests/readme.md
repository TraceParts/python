# Regarding unit tests

Most tests in their current configuration fail.
No real values have been configured because tests are directly connected to Production Data and any attempts will be
recorded there.

To run tests, you must first fill in the required values.
⚠️ Test results (token generation, queries, user creation, ...) are done in Product Data and are under your
responsibility ⚠️
